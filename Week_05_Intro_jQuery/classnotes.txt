Good Morning!  
  
REVIEW: 
> arrays (10 mins, code along)
=== 10_arrays/starter_code/arrays/js/exercise.js
=== fyi: the forEach loop; http://jsperf.com/fast-array-foreach
> functions (20 mins + optional pset)
=== review of arguments + return
=== patterns: function myFunction() {} vs. var myFunction = function() {}
=== anonymous functions: in js functions do not need names to be created! useful after the beep...
=== functions_review/js/script.js

INTRO: (10 mins)
> objects
=== very basic definition - mysterious 5th javascript variable - numbers, string, booleans, arrays, and objects

on object is a representation of a real world thing in javascript

object is a group of variables

how to declare an object

var num=5;
var string='c';
var bool=true;
var ar= [ 1, true, 'c' ];
var table = {};
table.legs = 4;
table.material = 'wood';
table.dimensions = [ 10,10 ];


var Child = {
	age: 3;
	


}
var empty = [];

=== object keys can be: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, functions, Array, or other Objects

jQuery: ( 1 hr-ish )
> wtheck is jquery, yo
> selectors
=== emphasize paradigm of CSS selectors -> jQuery objects
=== jQuery objs are array-like; they are not strictly arrays
=== jQuery_review/js/selectorsReview.js
> basic functions
=== show some examples; talk about events here
=== jQuery_review/js/basicMethodsReview.js

FUN STUFF!!!
> the divided times
=== you may use HTML and CSS, but NOT THE JS; don't even peek at it (pls)
=== we will use functions to 'automate' a lot of the coding that we must do for it
> image carousel
=== 10_arrays/starter_code/carousel_obfuscated/
=== we can just style this on our own together, keep it super simple
> image carousel with 'cuteness'

...plugins? maybe? maybe!
