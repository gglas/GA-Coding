HTMl keeps track of things using tags

always open and close tags at the same time

headings always have some padding inherently, it varies from computer to computer

div is a generic wrapper for HTML content
span is a generic wrapper for text

block elements vs inline elements- 
Block elements are forced to go to a new line - block elements have a concept of dimension, they have height and width
span, which is for text, doesn't receive height or width, they are meant to be text

Ex. if you put a bunch of inline elements they'll show up next to each other, whereas block elements would show up on top of each other

self closing tags
img is a major example
you can use absolute URLS or relative URLs
example, placekitten.com
always put a space between attribute and tag name

Don't insert a block element into an in-line element, for example, a div into a span
