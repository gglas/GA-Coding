Position Relative is with respect to itself, on an xy plane the origin is always the top left corner (where it wouldve been anyway) position absolute - it will be the window itself (if no container)

if a parent has position relative, it means that the absolute position is going to be based on the position relative 

position absolute is related to the body, unless it is nested within a container that has been assigned position relative

also does everything a float does and more - allows you to fine tune things relative to the div exactly where you put them
