* document flow removal - floats pull an item out of the docuemnt flow

overflow - css hack - overflow:hidden forces the container div to recognize floated divs within it.  this is the easiest, crappiest way to make it work

another way to keep the container div the right size is to add a div, and then set that div's parameters to "clear:both" = taqui has never used clears, it is basically the anti-float, use libraries that have float and clear already set

third way is to use the clearfix class - this would give you a container with stuff floated doing what overflow does without overflow - save clearfix as a macro
