Good morning!

1** js review

js can be included just like css
a** js runtime and how to include js
b** variables: numbers, strings, booleans 
c** basic vars review: up to #6

2** programming structs review
a** revisit psuedo code (thermostat stuff)
i** conditionals
ii** loops
iii** functions
*********ARGUMENTS!! -- maybe write a few functions?

== <CODE ALONG>: score keeper: http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/hAjtq ==
we will focus on how we can use functions to get this working (without DOM) first
== </CODE ALONG> ==

== <CODE ALONG>: comparator: http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/BkdqI ==
we will focus on combining functions with conditionals
== </CODE ALONG> ==

== <LAB> ==
Write a temperature converter
** it should take an input value in C
** it should output in DOM the F value
** you must use a function for the core conversion (google for this)
== </LAB> ==

3** advanced variables
a** arrays: use cases -- why an array? (graphs, temperatures, heights, math, marquee)
i** what kind of stuff goes in an array
b** arrays: usage -- create, read, update, delete
c** arrays: pset up to #6

4** loops
a** basic mechanics 
b** arrays: pset from #7 -> done
i** go back to #4 in pset and do this using an array

== <CODE ALONG>: http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/kBItz ==
Rewrite this code to use an array and ONE function
== </CODE ALONG> ==

== <CODE ALONG>: http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/uBkEr ==
putting it all together
== </CODE ALONG> ==

5** objects
a** basic definition
b** relation to javascript + jquery (DOM)
